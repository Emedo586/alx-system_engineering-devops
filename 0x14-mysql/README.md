# MY SQL

MySQL is a popular __open-source relational database management system (RDBMS)__ that enables users to store, manage, and retrieve structured data efficiently. It is widely used for various applications, from small-scale projects to large-scale websites and enterprise-level solutions.
MySQL powers many of the most accessed applications,including Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, Uber, Airbnb, Shopify, and Booking.com. MySQL is a client/server system that consists of a multithreaded SQL server that supports different back ends, several different client programs and libraries, administrative tools, and a widerange of application-programming interfaces (APIs).
The name "MySQL" is a combination of "My," the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, and "SQL," the acronym for Structured Query Language. MySQL is pronounced as "My ess-cue-el".

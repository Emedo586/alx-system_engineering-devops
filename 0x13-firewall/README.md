# FIREWALL

<p> A **firewall** is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It can be a software or hardware device that selectively blocks or allows data packets to pass through. Firewalls are typically used to secure private networks and the endpoint devices within them, known as network hosts. They are designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network while allowing authorized communications. Firewalls can be viewed as gated borders or gateways that manage the travel of permitted and prohibited web activity in a private network.</p>
